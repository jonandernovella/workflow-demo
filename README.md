#Microservices-based metabolomics workflow

Microservices is a software architecture style in which complex applications are divided into smaller, more narrow services. These constricted processes are independently deployable and compatible with one another like building blocks. In this manner, these blocks can be combined in multiple ways, creating pipelines of actions. 


In this repository we aim to introduce a microservice-based infrastructure for analysis of metabolomics data. The data used has been provided by the [CARAMBA] (http://www.medsci.uu.se/caramba/) team at Uppsala University and the main products used in the analsysis workflow are Docker, Jenkins and Mantl.
